# 2D to 3D Conversion with Colors and Textures

This project converts 2D images into high-quality 3D models, including depth maps, point clouds, and textured meshes.

## **Project Structure**
- `images/`: Input images folder.
- `outputs/`: Results including depth maps, point clouds, and textured 3D models.
- `src/`: Core Python scripts.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models (e.g., MiDaS).

## **Steps to Run**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
